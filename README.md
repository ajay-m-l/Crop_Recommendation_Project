# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

This project is a **machine learning-based Crop Recommendation System** that helps farmers decide the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental conditions
like **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH**, and **rainfall**.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts soil and climate input parameters
- Predicts the best crop to grow using ML algorithms
- Built using Python with models like **Random Forest** and **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- Easy-to-use CLI or GUI (optional)

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🧪 Algorithms Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## 📊 Input Parameters

- N: Nitrogen content in soil
- P: Phosphorous content in soil
- K: Potassium content in soil
- Temperature: in Celsius
- Humidity: %
- pH value of soil
- Rainfall: mm
